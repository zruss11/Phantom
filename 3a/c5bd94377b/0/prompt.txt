# Tauri Release

Bump versions and trigger CI releases for Tauri desktop applications.

## When to Use

- User requests a new release or version bump
- User says "release", "push a release", "new version", "bump to X.Y.Z"
- User wants to trigger a CI build for distribution

## Version File Locations

Tauri projects have version information in multiple files that must stay synchronized:

| File | Field | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` | `"version"` | Primary app version for distribution |
| `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` | `version` | Tauri frontend crate version |
| `backend/Cargo.toml` | `version` (if exists) | Backend crate version |

## Release Workflow

### 1. Determine Version

Parse the user's requested version. Common formats:
- Semantic: `1.2.3`
- Pre-release: `1.2.3-alpha1`, `1.2.3-beta2`, `1.2.3-rc1`
- If user says "patch bump", increment the patch version
- If user says "minor bump", increment the minor version

### 2. Update Version Files

Update all version files to the new version:

```bash
# tauri.conf.json - update the "version" field
# src-tauri/Cargo.toml - update version = "X.Y.Z"
# backend/Cargo.toml - update version = "X.Y.Z" (if exists)
```

### 3. Commit and Tag

Create a commit and tag following this pattern:

```bash
git add src-tauri/tauri.conf.json src-tauri/Cargo.toml backend/Cargo.toml
git commit -m "chore: bump version to X.Y.Z"
git tag vX.Y.Z
```

### 4. Push to Trigger CI

Push both the commit and tag to trigger CI release:

```bash
git push origin main --tags
```

The `v*` tag pattern triggers the release workflow which:
- Builds on macOS (ARM64)
- Signs with Apple certificates
- Generates `latest.json` for auto-updater
- Creates a draft GitHub release

## Version Format Guidelines

- Always use semver: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Pre-release suffix: `-alpha1`, `-beta2`, `-rc1`
- Tag prefix: Always use `v` prefix (e.g., `v1.2.3`)

## Post-Release

After CI completes, remind the user to:
1. Check GitHub Actions for successful build
2. Review the draft release
3. Publish when ready

## Notes

- No static `release.json` exists - CI generates `latest.json` dynamically
- Keep all Cargo.toml versions synchronized with tauri.conf.json
- The release workflow creates a **draft** release for review before publishing
