# Text Notes (Manual Scratch Pad)

## Goal
- Let users create and edit manual text notes inside the Notes page, with the existing agent chat sidebar available alongside.

## Manual Test Checklist
1. Open Notes, click the `+` button next to "My notes".
2. Verify a new note opens in the center panel with a writable text area (scratch pad).
3. Type a few lines, switch back to the default list, then reopen the note.
4. Verify the text persisted.
5. Verify the right-side agent chat still works and can reference the note text as context.
6. Optional: click `Copy` and verify clipboard contains the note text (or exported format).
